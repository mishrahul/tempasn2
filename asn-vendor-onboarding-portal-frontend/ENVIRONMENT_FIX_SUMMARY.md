# Environment Detection Fix Summary

## üö® Issue Identified
Your error logs revealed that the production build was incorrectly detecting itself as development mode:
```
environment: 'DEVELOPMENT'
url: 'https://supplier-connect-app.web.app/api/chat'
```

## üîß Root Cause Found
The `fileReplacements` configuration was missing from `angular.json`, which meant:
- Production builds were still using `environment.ts` instead of `environment.prod.ts`
- `environment.production` was `false` in production
- API calls used `/api/chat` instead of direct webhook URLs
- Firebase Hosting intercepted API calls and returned HTML

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied
Added the missing `fileReplacements` configuration to `angular.json`:

```json
"production": {
  "budgets": [...],
  "outputHashing": "all",
  "fileReplacements": [
    {
      "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
      "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix (Broken):
```javascript
// Console logs showed:
environment: 'DEVELOPMENT'
url: 'https://supplier-connect-app.web.app/api/chat'
status: 200 (but HTML content)
```

### After Fix (Working):
```javascript
// Console logs should show:
environment: 'PRODUCTION'
endpoint: 'https://apl-sandbox.taxgenie.online/webhook/asn-verification'
isDirectWebhookCall: true
```

## üìã Deployment and Testing Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the Fixed Build
```bash
# Build with the corrected configuration
npm run build:prod

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Detection
1. Open your production app: `https://supplier-connect-app.web.app`
2. Navigate to "AI Specialist" page
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Run: `debugApiRouting.showEnvironment()`

**Expected Output:**
```javascript
üåç Environment Information: {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: "",
  corsMode: "direct",
  currentUrl: "https://supplier-connect-app.web.app/ai-specialist",
  hostname: "supplier-connect-app.web.app"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Webhook Connectivity
In console, run: `debugApiRouting.testWebhook()`

**Expected Output (Success):**
```javascript
üß™ Testing webhook connectivity: https://apl-sandbox.taxgenie.online/webhook/asn-verification
üß™ Webhook test result: {
  status: 200,
  statusText: "OK",
  isHtml: false,
  responsePreview: "{\"response\":\"...\"}",
  url: "https://apl-sandbox.taxgenie.online/webhook/asn-verification"
}
‚úÖ Webhook test successful: Received non-HTML response
```

### Step 4: Test Actual API Calls
1. Try sending a message through the AI chat interface
2. Monitor console for logs

**Expected Output (Success):**
```javascript
üöÄ Sending message to AI endpoint: {
  environment: "PRODUCTION",
  endpoint: "https://apl-sandbox.taxgenie.online/webhook/asn-verification",
  webhookUrl: "https://apl-sandbox.taxgenie.online/webhook/asn-verification",
  isDirectWebhookCall: true
}
```

**No more errors like:**
```javascript
üö® FIREBASE HOSTING ISSUE DETECTED!
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Environment Still Shows Development:
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Verify the build used `--configuration production`
3. Check that `environment.prod.ts` has `production: true`

### If Webhook Test Still Returns HTML:
This could indicate:
1. CORS issues with the n8n webhook
2. Network routing problems
3. n8n webhook configuration issues

### If API Calls Still Fail:
1. Check webhook URL configuration in app settings
2. Verify n8n webhook is accessible
3. Check for authentication requirements

## üéØ Success Indicators

‚úÖ **Environment Detection Working:**
- Console shows `environment: 'PRODUCTION'`
- API endpoint is the direct webhook URL
- No `/api/chat` URLs in logs

‚úÖ **API Routing Working:**
- Webhook test returns JSON, not HTML
- No "Firebase hosting intercepting" errors
- AI chat returns proper responses

‚úÖ **Complete Fix:**
- No more HTTP 200 errors with HTML content
- AI chat functionality works in production
- Console logs show successful API calls

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fix** using the steps above
2. **Run the debug tests** to verify the fix
3. **Test the AI chat functionality** end-to-end
4. **Monitor console logs** for any remaining issues

If you encounter any issues after deployment, the debug functions will help identify the specific problem and guide us to the appropriate solution.

The fix should resolve the core environment detection issue and allow your production app to make direct webhook calls as intended.
